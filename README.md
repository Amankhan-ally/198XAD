<h3> 198XAD MILITARY OPERATING SYSTEM </h3>

This operating system will have super capabilities. Unlike other OSe's this OS will have full
control on its hardware as if it is a kernel  and can switch between UserMode and KernelMode
anytime.

The primary objective of this OS is to control other electronic devices, it will scan for
nearest electronic device and depending upon the architecture of the scanned device it will
then transmit low level signals to manipulate target device hardaware to get access to its
core.
